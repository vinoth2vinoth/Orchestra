## ⚡ The Enterprise-Grade Alternative to Mintlify & Swimm

DocArchitect is designed for developers who demand **privacy, cost-efficiency, and elite accuracy.** 

| Feature | SaaS Tools (Mintlify, Swimm) | **DocArchitect** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Sovereignty** | Snapshots stored in vendor clouds; potential for metadata leaks. | **100% Local.** Your code only hits the LLM endpoint you specify via your private API key. |
| **LLM Flexibility** | Locked to vendor-selected models. | **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key).** Choose from `DeepSeek-V3`, `Claude 3.5`, `GPT-4o`, or `Gemini`. |
| **Pricing Model** | Fixed monthly subscriptions with seat-based billing. | **Pay-per-Token.** Only pay for what you use directly to your LLM provider. |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | Proprietary formats or metadata requirements. | **Standard Markdown.** Pure .md files that work perfectly with GitHub, Jekyll, or Docusaurus. |
| **Context Window** | Restricted by SaaS infrastructure limits per page. | **Architectural Depth.** Can digest 30,000+ characters of context to map cross-file dependencies. |
| **Air-Gap Support** | Requires internet access to vendor servers. | **CI/CD Native.** Can run in any private runner, proxy, or restricted environment. |

## 🚀 Quick Start in 60 Seconds

### 1. Installation
Install globally via NPM or use `npx` for a zero-install experience:
```bash
npm install -g doc-architect
```

### 2. Configure Your Environment
DocArchitect automatically detects your API keys from your environment. **DeepSeek is the recommended choice for high-intelligence logic at minimal cost.**

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_api_key"
# OR set OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY
```

### 3. Initialize your Project
Create a `doc-architect.json` file in your root directory:

```json
{
  "sourceRoot": "./src",
  "docsRoot": "./docs",
  "provider": "deepseek",
  "model": "deepseek-chat",
  "mappings": {
    "core-logic": "architecture.md",
    "api-v1": "api-reference.md",
    "auth-flow": "security.md"
  }
}
```

### 4. Sync Your Docs
```bash
doc-architect
```

## 🏗 Why "Architecture-Aware"?

Most AI doc tools treat files as isolated text islands. **DocArchitect sees the whole continent.** 

When you define a mapping, DocArchitect feeds the relevant code blocks into the LLM context, allowing it to understand:
1. **Dependency Graphs**: How Class A in `user.ts` interacts with Service B in `auth.ts`.
2. **Data Pipelines**: How an API request flows from the controller to the database layer.
3. **Implicit Logic**: The design patterns and architectural decisions that aren't obvious in single-file summaries.

## 🤖 Advanced Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Recommended |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `provider` | Choose from `deepseek`, `openai`, `anthropic`, or `google`. | `deepseek` |
| `model` | Specific model ID (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-5-sonnet`). | `deepseek-chat` |
| `maxCodeChars` | Maximum source code characters to analyze per block (context limit). | `30000` |
| `include` | Glob patterns for source files to be analyzed. | `["**/*.{ts,py,go...}"]` |
